gitclone("https://github.com/informacja/fig", "figLib", Depth=1);
addpath(strcat(fullfile(userpath),"/figLib")); addpath(strcat(fullfile(userpath),"/figLib/extras")); savepath;
cd(proj_path); clc; fprintf(1,'To save current figure, just type here "figPW" (if not exist, empty will be created)\nAfter that you can type "help figPW" for more information about function arguments.\nIf you want save all opened figures just run "figPSW". For more information about whole library type "help fig"\n')
```

proj_path = pwd; cd(fullfile(userpath)); fprintf(1,'Uninstalling ... "figLib"\n'); if(exist("figLib","dir")) rmdir("figLib", 's'); end
rmpath(strcat(fullfile(userpath),"/figLib")); rmpath(strcat(fullfile(userpath),"/figLib/extras")); savepath;
cd(proj_path); fprintf(1,'Succesfully uninstalled "figLib"\n')
```
## Example for saving figures to pdf (for article)

```matlab
figPW art % paste and run in Command Window
```
 
*If you have deleted or permission error, check you have opened file in PDF reader*

### Article data flow proposed to use with figLib
What is interesting you don't have to open the github.com, is possible to use only Github Desktiop and Overleaf (in real work process). 

Everything what is needed, is an account on github and enabled synchronization with Desktop app and Overleaf.
